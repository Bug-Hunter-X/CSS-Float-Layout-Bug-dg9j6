To resolve this issue, use the clearfix hack. Add the following CSS class to the parent container:

```css
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  clear: both;
  display: table;
}
```

This will clear the floats, ensuring proper layout.  Modify your HTML to include the `clearfix` class on the parent container:

```html
<div class="clearfix">
  <!-- Your floated elements here -->
</div>
```

This ensures that the parent container correctly accounts for the widths of its floated children, preventing unexpected layout issues.
