The following CSS code snippet might cause unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This seemingly harmless code can lead to unexpected layout issues if not handled carefully. The problem arises when the total width of floated elements exceeds the parent container's width.
